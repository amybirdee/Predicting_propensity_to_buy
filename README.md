# Propensity_to_buy

- The data consist of details of customers at Pedal Power, a hypothetical company selling home exercise bikes

- There are over 200,000 rows of customer data. I have assumed the data span one week 

- Included in the data are variables such as whether or not a customer logged into their account, whether they are a returning user, whether they saw the checkout page and whether or not they placed an order for a bike

- This project aims to segment the customer data and build a classifier model which will predict whether or not a customer will place an order 

- The machine learning models used in the project are a logistic regression and Random Forest. The hyper-parameters of the Random Forest model were tuned in an attempt to build an optimal model
